# Centralspindlin-mediated RhoGEF distribution simulation

### Brandt Warecki

...

**Requirements**

This code (rho_position_simulation_commented.R) runs in R (https://www.r-project.org/)

...

This code requires the following packages:

ggplot2 (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

dplyr (https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

RColorBrewer (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html)

which can be installed using:

```
install.packages("ggplot2")

install.packages("dplyr")

install.packages("RColorBrewer")
```

**Usage**

The code should be run in its entirety: within the downloaded script document, command-A then command-Enter.

It should take ~<5-10 min to run.

Output is 3 unsaved dataframes and 5 saved graphs.

If the 5 output graphs do not display correctly, try running each graph separately (no need to run the simulations again).

This code was originally run on a Macbook Pro (macOS Big Sur 11.2.3) in R (4.0.5) with ggplot2 (3.3.5), dplyr (1.0.7), and RColorBrewer (1.1-3).
